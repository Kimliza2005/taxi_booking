        <p class="m-5 text-gray-900 text-[18px]">We value the trust and responsibility clients place with us. Through training, 
            vehicle maintenance and good planning, we strive to minimize risk, incidents and accidents, and to ensure the safety and well-being of all our 
            customers. But all risks cannot be eliminated entirely — Cambodian driving standards are not as advanced as many western countries ... the other
             driver may not be as responsible, carry insurance or license. For that reason we provide full insurance cover for our vehicles and passengers.
              There are two forms of insurance cover. The first is the inclusive Passenger Insurance and Third Party Liability. This provides the necessary 
              cover in the event of accident and injury to passengers or other people affected. The second insurance is Service. This helps underwrite the 
              cost of repair or recovery in the event of a vehicle breakdown: It ensures the fast response wherever a vehicle might be in the country. 
              We provide these vital safety backups for you peace of mind. We hope for the best but plan for the worst. In this way, we are properly prepared
               to look after your safety and interests, whatever the situation.</p>
